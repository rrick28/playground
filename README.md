### Steps
- Clone this repository into your home directory.

- create a new branch called `task1`
- switch to the `task1` branch.
------
- Within the terminal create a new folder called `folder1`. Use the `mkdir <folder_name>` command to accomplish this task. You can see the `man` pages for more information about the `mkdir` command. Enter `man mkdir` and read the documentation. press `q` when you're finished reading.
- Change directory to `folder1` with the `cd` command.
- Within `folder1` create a file called `file1.md`. Use the `touch` command to create a new file within the terminal. See `man touch` for information on how to create a file.
- use `vim`, a command line editor to edit `file1.md`.  Calling `vim file1.md` in the terminal will start the editor and open `file1.md`.
- Recreate this file in `file1.md`. See this [this markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for help with markdown syntax. `file1.md` should look the same as this `README.md` when you're finished.

**Do not include to file1.md**
- Add the file and with the following commit message: `this is a commit message`. Then push your changes to git with `git push`.
